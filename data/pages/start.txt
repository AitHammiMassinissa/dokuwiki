CS-DC’21 is the World e-Conference organized by the Complex Systems Digital Campus (CS-DC), a UNESCO UniTwin. It is devoted to all scientists involved in the transdisciplinary challenges of complex systems, crossing theoretical questions with experimental observations of multi-level dynamics. The previous one is CS-DC’15. It is open to e-satellite workshop CALL

CS-DC’n series is breaking new ground by enabling participation in a major scientific event without conference fees and without the need to travel – a concept at the heart of the international UNESCO UniTwin, embracing scientists from low-income and distant countries.

All selected presentations are given via our videoconference system. They are recorded and can be replayed later on for research and for education purposes, without time limit.

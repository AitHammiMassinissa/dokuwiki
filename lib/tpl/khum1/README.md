# Khum1, Dokuwiki template for Khaganat

## Description

This template is based on default Dokuwiki template (version available on 2020-04-09).

It try to be responsive and accessible.

Design is for Khaganat, a wonderful open project. Feel free to use it if you Dokuwiki is inspired by Khaganat ; probably better to adapt it at your taste if you have an other project.

It s better with [sidebar](https://www.dokuwiki.org/faq:sidebar). Wiki without sidebar are like a dishes without salt.

## Plugin support
Khum1 is designed to integrate certain plugins in particular. They have special css or hack on the template. It work without this plugin too !

* [Children pages](https://forge.dotslashplay.it/vv221/dokuwiki-childrenpages) to have tab on top article
* [Translation](http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:translation). 

It work well with a lot of plugin too, without hack :)

## Installation
When this template is ready:
Install it like any other template. Do "search and install" in the extension manager, find "Khum1", select and install it. 

Manually :
Download the folder, rename it "khum1" if it has another name, and put it in 'dokuwki/lib/tpl/'. 

And after, choose it in admin configuration.
